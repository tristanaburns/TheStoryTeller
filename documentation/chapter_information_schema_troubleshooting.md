# Chapter Information Schema Troubleshooting Guide

This guide addresses common issues encountered when working with the Chapter Information Schema and provides practical solutions.

## Cross-Reference Errors

### Issue: Referenced IDs Don't Exist

**Symptoms:**
- Validation errors indicating missing character, location, or event entries
- References to IDs that don't match any entries in their respective databases

**Solutions:**
1. **Run a validation check** first to identify all missing references:
   ```
   $ validate-database --check-references chapter_information.json
   ```

2. **Create missing entries** for any characters, locations, or events referenced but not defined:
   ```json
   // Create entry in character_database.json
   {
     "id": "char-missing-character-001",
     "name": "Character Name",
     // ...other required fields
   }
   ```

3. **Use placeholder entries** temporarily if you need to reference something that will be created later:
   ```json
   {
     "id": "character-placeholder-001",
     "name": "CHARACTER TO BE CREATED LATER",
     "status": "placeholder",
     // Minimal required fields
   }
   ```

## Timeline Inconsistencies

### Issue: Chapter Timeline Conflicts with Master Timeline

**Symptoms:**
- Chapter events occurring before preceding chapter ends
- Events referenced that haven't happened yet according to timeline
- Characters appearing in locations they couldn't reach based on timeline

**Solutions:**
1. **Create a timeline visualization** to spot inconsistencies:
   ```
   $ generate-timeline-visual --from chapter-001 --to chapter-010
   ```

2. **Adjust chapter dates** to maintain consistency:
   ```json
   "narrative_time": {
     "start_date": "1180-03-20",  // Updated from 1180-03-15
     "end_date": "1180-03-24"     // Updated from 1180-03-19
   }
   ```

3. **Document timeline anomalies** if they're intentional:
   ```json
   "timeline_notes": {
     "anomalies": [
       {
         "description": "Character appears before their official introduction",
         "explanation": "Time travel element to be revealed in Chapter 8",
         "is_intentional": true
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

## Character Arc Inconsistencies

### Issue: Character Development Discontinuity

**Symptoms:**
- Character ending state in one chapter doesn't match starting state in next
- Personality shifts without explanation
- Relationships changing without documented pivot moments

**Solutions:**
1. **Create a character arc tracker** across chapters:
   ```
   $ generate-character-arc --character char-benkei-001 --from chapter-001 --to chapter-010
   ```

2. **Document transition explanations** for significant shifts:
   ```json
   "character_arcs": {
     "char-benkei-001": {
       // ...existing fields...
       "transition_explanation": "Offscreen event between chapters explains personality shift",
       "requires_flashback": true
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Add intermediate character states** if needed:
   ```json
   "character_arcs": {
     "char-benkei-001": {
       "arc_type": "complex",
       "states": [
         {
           "state": "Initial reluctance",
           "pivot_to_next": "event-first-battle-001"
         },
         {
           "state": "Grudging respect",
           "pivot_to_next": "event-life-saving-001"
         },
         {
           "state": "Full loyalty"
         }
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

## Structural Issues

### Issue: Incomplete or Unbalanced Chapter Structure

**Symptoms:**
- Missing key narrative elements (introduction, climax, resolution)
- Disproportionate focus on certain elements
- Pacing problems identified in editorial notes

**Solutions:**
1. **Generate a chapter structure visualization**:
   ```
   $ analyze-chapter-structure chapter-warriors-oath-001
   ```

2. **Compare with narrative templates**:
   ```
   $ compare-to-template chapter-warriors-oath-001 --template three-act-structure
   ```

3. **Document restructuring needs** in editorial notes:
   ```json
   "editorial_notes": {
     // ...existing notes...
     "structural_revisions": [
       "Expand middle section to balance pacing",
       "Add transition between battle scene and character reflection",
       "Consider moving flashback earlier in chapter"
     ]
   }
   ```

## Theme Documentation Issues

### Issue: Inadequate Theme Documentation

**Symptoms:**
- Themes listed without explanation of how they're expressed
- Missing connections between themes and specific events
- Inconsistent theme tracking across chapters

**Solutions:**
1. **Enhance theme documentation** with specific manifestations:
   ```json
   "primary_themes": [
     {
       "theme_id": "theme-finding-purpose-001",
       "manifestations": [
         {
           "event_id": "event-benkei-oath-001",
           "description": "Benkei finds purpose through service to Yoshi"
         },
         {
           "dialogue_reference": "Then my path is yours",
           "description": "Verbal confirmation of new purpose"
         }
       ]
     }
   ]
   ```

2. **Create theme evolution trackers** across chapters:
   ```
   $ track-theme-evolution --theme theme-finding-purpose-001 --from chapter-001 --to chapter-010
   ```

3. **Document theme intersections** where multiple themes interact:
   ```json
   "theme_intersections": [
     {
       "primary_theme": "theme-finding-purpose-001",
       "secondary_theme": "theme-protocol-necessity-001",
       "intersection_point": "event-mountain-path-landslide-001",
       "description": "Benkei's new purpose comes into conflict with protocol when Yoshi is in danger"
     }
   ]
   ```

## Version Control Issues

### Issue: Conflicting or Outdated Chapter Information

**Symptoms:**
- Multiple versions of chapter information with different content
- Information doesn't match current chapter content
- Inconsistent version numbering

**Solutions:**
1. **Implement version tracking** in metadata:
   ```json
   "metadata": {
     "creation_date": "2025-03-17T00:00:00Z",
     "last_modified": "2025-04-03T00:00:00Z",
     "version": 1.3,
     "previous_versions": [
       {
         "version": 1.2,
         "date": "2025-03-28T00:00:00Z",
         "change_summary": "Updated character arcs after chapter revision"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **Add chapter content hash** to verify matching version:
   ```json
   "metadata": {
     // ...existing metadata...
     "content_hash": "a1b2c3d4e5f6",
     "hash_algorithm": "md5"
   }
   ```

3. **Create update notifications** when chapter content changes:
   ```
   $ monitor-chapter-changes --notify-on-update
   ```
