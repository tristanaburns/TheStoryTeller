# The Shadow Team Chronicles: Writing Schemas Guide

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the writing schemas used in The Shadow Team Chronicles universe. It covers narrative structure, writing styles, scene types, and prose variation. For practical implementation steps, see the [Writing Schemas Usage Guide](writing_schemas_usage_guide.md).

## Narrative Structure & Hierarchy

All content in The Shadow Team Chronicles follows a structured hierarchy, defined in `enums/narrative_structure_schema.json`:

```
Storyline → Volume → Act → Story → Chapter → Passage → Part
```

### Hierarchical Structure Explained

Each level has a specific purpose within the narrative framework:

1. **Storyline**: Overarching narrative arc spanning multiple volumes
   - Example: "The Shadow Team Chronicles: Rise of Neo-Tokyo"

2. **Volume**: Major section of a storyline with particular phase or theme
   - Example: "Volume 1: Corporate Shadows"

3. **Act**: Significant narrative shift or thematic change within a volume
   - Example: "Act II: The Resistance Emerges"

4. **Story**: Contained plot arc within an act
   - Example: "The Den of Wolves"

5. **Chapter**: Major event-based division within a story
   - Example: "Chapter 5: Infiltration"

6. **Passage**: Cinematic scene within a chapter
   - Example: "The Mountain Path"

7. **Part**: Smallest unit of narrative
   - Example: "Part 3: The Ambush"

## Natural Prose Variation

To ensure writing feels organic rather than formulaic, implement techniques from `enums/prose_variation_technique_schema.json`:

### Prose Variation Techniques

1. **Sentence Structure Variation**
   - Alternate between simple, compound, complex, and compound-complex sentences
   - Create natural rhythm through varied structural patterns

2. **Descriptive Vocabulary Diversification**
   - Use varied word choices when describing recurring elements
