      "summary": "The Warriors Oath continues directly from The Bridge of Fate, detailing the legendary duel between Yoshi and Benkei at Gojo Bridge. Using three precision cuts that each demonstrate a principle of combat, Yoshi defeats the powerful Benkei, who has collected 999 swords from previous victories. Impressed by Yoshi's skill and philosophy, Benkei kneels and pledges his loyalty with the words 'Then my path is yours.' The pair begin traveling north from Kyoto, with Benkei following at the formal three paces distance of a retainer. During their journey, they encounter a hunter tracking a wounded boar, and Yoshi surprises both the hunter and Benkei by ordering the boar to be shared with the hunter's village rather than claimed as their own. Later, when crossing a treacherous mountain path in heavy rain, Benkei breaks protocol to save Yoshi from falling, marking a significant evolution in their relationship. They are subsequently ambushed by mercenaries working for the Taira clan who recognize Yoshi as Minamoto. Yoshi orders Benkei to stand aside and single-handedly defeats all five attackers without killing them, demonstrating his extraordinary combat skill and strategic restraint. The chapter concludes with a flashback to Benkei's troubled childhood at a monastery, revealing how his uncontrollable strength and warrior nature conflicted with monastic ideals, leading to his eventual departure and search for purpose that culminated in the collection of swords at Gojo Bridge. This chapter establishes the foundation of Yoshi and Benkei's legendary partnership while exploring themes of purpose, complementary strengths, and the tension between formal protocol and practical necessity.",
